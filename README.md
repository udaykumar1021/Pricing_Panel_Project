# Pricing_Panel_Project
I have builded a simple pricing table for different price descriptions using flexbox and mediaquery bringing responsive for the user inputs taking reference from codepen, basically it will be helpful for resizing the desktop so that when we shrinking/growing contents over desktop either it is form row to column or column to row the elements will be alligned in a well designed manner.for this css reset tool helped me for a default padding,margins,font-sizes and headings using css code . By using HTML and CSS along with some custom input imaages I've achieved this.
